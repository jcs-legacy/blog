# Framework I have been working - Part 1-

The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of 
our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts 
work on the same project, and of course for game development students we 
decide to make a AR game.

Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always 
not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game 
industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and 
the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and 
every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I 
think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first 
day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.

Because for whole semester I was so stressful, so I did not remember much what 
I did for the class in details. In fact, I did everything except the art for 
the project. It was fun and I did learn three things from this class.

* Never repeat yourself. (Duplicate code)
* Design Patterns.
* New technology is dangerous.

Never repeat yourself, and the duplicate code is a significant part to be a 
good programmer Because duplicate code will cause copy and paste everywhere 
around the place. In architecture wise, copy and pasting the code everywhere 
is not a good structure and it could cause an issue if the program gets huge 
enough that you could not maintain the whole software. I am not saying I made 
the duplicate on this project, but what does annoying me is that I have nearly 
created everything the same over and over again in each project I have made 
from scratch. For instance, a scene manager could probably create for all kind 
of game because what kind of game does not need to switch a scene? Even a bad 
game will still need to switch scene from menu to gameplay.

Design Patterns is the key for extreme programming and maintainability for 
software architecture. Prevent duplicate code is also the topic include 
from the design patterns. I would recommand people read
['Head First Design Pattern'](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bobQSPQrL.jpg)
that are written by Eric Freeman and Elisabth Robson. The example code was 
written in Java and as everyone knows that Java is a good programming language 
when people need to explain OOP concepts.

Otherwise, there is another option book
['Design Patterns'](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q-RLSadrL.jpg)
written by a bunch of good C++ programmers, for people who feel more comfortable 
with using C++ than using Java.
