# Aboue me!


# Welcome to the Jen-Chieh Shen's Blog!

Welcome to my blog. I don’t think that I’m particularly talented, and I don’t
believe in natural born talent. I believe that it takes hard work to achieve
great things. I’m not religious, but if there is a god, he hasn’t done me any
favors. I’m a bit lazy and I like to have my personal space; like to contemplate
with the thing that stimulates my curiosity. Enjoy observing people, emotions,
and deducting future by present facts. If you want to know more about me, check

I fell in love with computer science in 2013. I made this blog mostly from scratch
using basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. I’d like to
share my process and experience making software on this blog.

I have other interests as well, though I’m not an expert in any of them. I like
physics, because it can explain so much that happens in our daily lives. I enjoy
math, as it can represent so much with symbols and formulas. I also like philosophy
and how it can help people think more critically.one of my favorites quotes is
"Knowledge is power."
