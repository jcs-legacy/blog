In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying ‚ÄúData Structure‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlgorithms‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesign Patterns‚Äù. What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc. On top of these concepts, this is the third framework I built. I could not remember what I built for the previous two framworks. I presume that I have some knowledge about building a framework, library, etc. At the beginning of the JCSUnity development process, I have had studied the basis of the game engine architecture but not quite fully understand the Unity Engine itself. For instance, Unity Engine‚Äôs Scripting API, and some controls specific for Unity Eninge. Because of this, you might realized some of the code or design are a bit fiddle and inconsistent. When I am writing this article, the framework itself has been developed to the state that is convoluted and hard to maintain. Within this framework, there are around 400 to 500 scripts, most of the scripts are self executed which mean a script is a component that could run by it own. By this idea, one Self-Runnable Script benefits the design and increase the variation possibility but it also brings the cost of unnecessary performance.

I am just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my Emacs and Vim repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs. Lead to the conclusion; I use Emacs more often than Vim. Before Vim users left the website, I would like to hold onto the basis, why I chose Emacs for my most frequently used text editor. First and foremost, I organized the editor users into two groups. Base on my own experiences, people who use Emacs are most likely work in the software development industry. On the other hand, the majority of Vim users works either in cybersecurity or a free hacker. The reasons are pretty much straightforward, as a software engineer, I would much appreciate Emacs' design. Emacs' architecture brings a lot more spaces and flexibilities to the software development workflow, and it maximizes the changing possibilities to the software engineer. Most of the software development is most likely to stay in a program that could likeliest achieve most of the tasks. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes, it is just another way of saying the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Of course, Vim could possibly do what Emacs does, extends to Vim‚Äôs original design, I found that conflict Vim is an editor design for fast editing file in terminal. Comparing the two editors, Emacs had been built the way what software developer wants; Vim would most likely lose in this battle on this aspect. Vice versa, Vim are very popular to those who do not need an IDE to do their job and often require to exit text editor to jump to other software, do not even argues that Vim is moving towards to Emacs' design. Well, this leads to a problem that I could not find a good reason for having the conflict between the original design fast editing file in terminal and having multiple plugins or configurations in Vim. Though, if Vim starts moving towards to Emacs‚Äôs design, does that mean Vim will lose the advantage on fast editing file in terminal? Many of Vim users complains Emacs was too big and cost so much of its' starting time, but now they want more plugins or configurations to their Vim settings? Emacs was designed between the lightweight text editor and heavyweight IDE, resulting Emacs could not going to be faster than Vim on the starting time, but it brings benefits to people who will like a ‚Äòlightweight IDE‚Äô, it retains most functionalities from any IDE, or even better, program yourself one! If Emacs is that good why still not many people using it? The reason could be straightforward, I learned Emacs from scratch without any in-between supports like Spacemacs or Doom-emacs. I found that Emacs main website is not that friendly compared to other many sites. Plus, you could barely saw videos online that are about Emacs. Furthermore, compares to Vim‚Äôs shortcuts design, Emacs have less cognitive shortcuts consequent people having a hard time learning Emacs' shortcuts comparing learning Vim‚Äôs shortcuts. I would doubt anyone would likely to learn Emacs by having all these kind of challenges or difficulties in front of them. The learning curve is steep, and the cost of learning a new language for editing Emacs' configuration, which is EmacsLisp, could be an extra cost of time. If you notice programming language Lisp, then maybe this would be too obscure to you. In my case, I have no experience with programming language Lisp which leads me many hassles while learning EmacsLisp. I have been using Emacs for 4 years, and I still could not say that I am an expert to Emacs.

I think some programmer have some kind of religion, so I am not going to tell anyone to use any particular text editor. I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer make a software and get their job done. At my previous post ' Framework I have been working‚Ä¶ (Part 2) ' I mentioned I watched a few episodes of ' Handmade Hero ‚Äôs series. Casey Muratori was using Emacs as a text editor coding C/C++(I think now he use 4coder instead of Emacs). I was surprised by how fast he can code in Emacs. So I made some research and discovered there is Vim which is another great text editor competing with Emacs. I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim. First, I would like to talk about why I chose Emacs over Vim. I think Emacs can do almost everything that Vim does. Vim stays cool he just wants to be a text editor and does not want to do something else. Emacs design the way that you could turn Emacs from text editor to something else. And of course, Emacs is not perfect. Emacs has few troubles doing something like you still need to use third-party software in order to run a package, and sometimes Emacs just froze when I am just trying to edit a text file. Emacs is just a right tool for me because I use to want a text editor that could edit any programming languages and do anything inside it. On the other hand, you might say that is gross to have a text editor do all kind of job for you. Why do not we just use another program instead of code in elisp and write your own functionality for Emacs? Is that even worth it? The answer is really depend on who is using it. For me, I program in different programming languages; I would somehow need to use other text editor or IDE when I change to code in another programming language. For example, I code Java and C++ I would have to change from ‚ÄòEclipse‚Äô/‚ÄòAndroid Studio‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisual Studio‚Äô/‚ÄòMonoDevelop‚Äô. And these IDEs has different key bindings, which I really hate because I would somehow make mistakes by pressing the wrong key binding from previous IDE to current IDE. In this case, Emacs/Vim become useful because I could finally code all programming languages with the same key bindings. On the other hand, if you are a front-end developer you would recommend people use Sublime Text instead of Emacs because it is wasting your time and is not worth it anymore.

Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity. Because for whole semester I was so stressful, so I did not remember much what I did for the class in details. In fact, I did everything except the art for the project. It was fun and I did learn three things from this class. Never repeat yourself. (Duplicate code) Design Patterns. New technology is dangerous. Never repeat yourself, and the duplicate code is a significant part to be a good programmer Because duplicate code will cause copy and paste everywhere around the place. In architecture wise, copy and pasting the code everywhere is not a good structure and it could cause an issue if the program gets huge enough that you could not maintain the whole software. I am not saying I made the duplicate on this project, but what does annoying me is that I have nearly created everything the same over and over again in each project I have made from scratch. For instance, a scene manager could probably create for all kind of game because what kind of game does not need to switch a scene? Even a bad game will still need to switch scene from menu to gameplay. Design Patterns is the key for extreme programming and maintainability for software architecture. Prevent duplicate code is also the topic include from the design patterns. I would recommand people read ‚ÄòHead First Design Pattern‚Äô that are written by Eric Freeman and Elisabth Robson. The example code was written in Java and as everyone knows that Java is a good programming language when people need to explain OOP concepts. Otherwise, there is another option book ‚ÄòDesign Patterns‚Äô written by a bunch of good C++ programmers, for people who feel more comfortable with using C++ than using Java. At this time, one of my instructor [Billy Garban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billylemonzest/) from Academy of Art University suggests me to watch [Handmade Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) series that host by [Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori) . I have watched a few episodes what make me impressive is how he can teach people in such a way that everyone could understand, including me. I like when he talks about what makes him special is his productivity to the company. (I will discuss a bit more 'productivity' in another post.) This changes me think differently instead of just thinking about algorithm and data structure. What makes you different than other programmers? Then I realize, being productive is important and advance as a programmer. Then I figure out that how to make myself productive as much as possible is to write your own tool. The reason is simple, the majority of people that are not programmer might think of the most time programmer did is to type the program itself, but I believe this is a huge mistake. In fact, the time spending on thinking is way more than time spent on actually typing. So writing your own tool is saving your time when you think. Here is a list of some frameworks or libraries that I have created for my own use during my college years. All of them have a different purpose, and some of them were written in various programming language. These are also the evidence that these tools did save me a lot of time when doing my school work.

Primarily I‚Äôm nobody, not phenomenal, and never been onto news or other media, not any of those. Is hard to think that who will spend their precious time reading this ‚ÄòAbout Me‚Äô article. I would desire not to write a verbose introduction about myself. I‚Äôm currently 24; I wouldn‚Äôt say that I lived long, but long enough for me to review my past few years of living and consider what‚Äôs the future path I‚Äôm going to step in. The story always starts sad; it was entirely a disaster in my early life. I‚Äôm very pessimistic, give up things quickly, and not knowing how to be persistent. Wonder where are the differences between success and failure. Maybe I do have gifts for doing things right, but not for long. When I grew up a little, I‚Äôm already at the bottom of the class. I usually couldn‚Äôt be proud of myself especially when you have brothers and sisters that they often did things better than you. Util to the day first year of middle school, my life of concepts has a drastic change; my grade stays at the average rate, but instead of focusing on grades, my parent chose to have me entered the athletic class in tennis rather than the regular class. I felt motivated about sports comparing to coursework. During spartan training from our coaches, plus my innate health doesn‚Äôt take any advantages to make me successful in tennis. I finally got my first specialty by been through all the rigorous training. Form this experience; I learned the importance of being persistent, sometime you couldn‚Äôt care for all the possibilities, and confidence. Last year of the middle school years, I went back to the regular class. I decide to challenge something that I was always trying to avoid, studying. In the beginning, this wasn‚Äôt easy for me by doing something that isn‚Äôt that interesting. In a certain opportunity, I get to know some thoughts about life, which are ‚ÄúLife aren‚Äôt always happy.‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn some aspect, no one like to study.‚Äù. I kept these thoughts in mind and started to do the hard work on studying. Surprisingly, my grades have some improvements. Although this could not be enough to be like the top 3 in our school, this makes me comprehend somethings that are way more important than the grade. ‚ÄúExertion wouldn‚Äôt betray you.‚Äù and ‚ÄúKnowing the taste of success, would make you feel omnipotent.‚Äù There are a lot of things that happened in high school. The truths are that not everything goes perfectly throughout my life. During my high school life is my first time getting bullied at school, not physically but metaphysically. I reckon because I was too proud and aggressive at that time and I argued all the subtleties and most of the time I was right. Consequent that being always right does not mean success in real life. I was in despair about the reality and learned some significant lessons, not arguing so much and be humble. After the worst part of my life, I started to get in touch with people carefully. I attempted to learn how to talk to people and endeavored to be modest. I would like to search for my equanimity at any time and face things more mature. My life wasn‚Äôt going smooth all the time; I underwent both pleasing and hurtful part of my life. I‚Äôm not like Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla that smart. I learned lessons from every failure, and knowing from failure to success. Most of the time paying hard works wouldn‚Äôt get what you want, but you could change your life only if you tried.
