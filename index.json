First of all, there is nothing wrong with the Emacs' devel. They did a great job keeping Emacs alive, and I like their mentality and most of their technical decisions. For me, the problem is the Elisp dev ecosystem (not the Emacs community itself; consider the Elisp dev ecosystem is the subset of the Emacs community). I appreciate people willing to contribute to Emacs, but I hate when they don’t consider their packages' cross-platform capability. Yes, I’m a Windows user; actually, I use all the most used systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). I hate that when I try a package, it only works on a specific system (excluding packages that only rely on certain systems), but it is supposed to work on all systems. I feel terrible and frustrated because most of the Elisp dev does not care or does not care enough about the minority users (Windows users). Even some famous packages don’t work well on Windows, magit is slow, straight.el is slow, helm is slow, ivy is slow, projectile is broken, eping is broken, EAF is constatly broken, etc. I use over 500 packages in my configuration. I can list a ton of packages that have terrible cross-platform capability. But are they all bad? Of course not. Most of the authors show patience and are willing to help you with the issue you have encountered. At least they have tried to solve these issues and provide a workaround, etc. Like magit has a GitHub issue (magit/#2982) that explicitly talking about the Windows performance. EAF authors and maintainers constantly respond to the users they have trouble with. These projects are amazing, and I appreciate them so much! But most of them aren’t like that… Unfortunately, they either don’t care or don’t care enough. In the 2020 Emacs survey, Windows users are only 8%! I’ve heard a lot of people claim I’m wrong. First of all, I’m in the minority; only God knows what we think. Second of all, I wish more than anyone I am wrong. I don’t care if I’m wrong or not. I want the UX to be improved! Many people complain about the OS (Windows), suggest using the WSL, etc. But that’s not the issue. Ignoring the issue is the issue! If you can’t solve the issue from another platform, don’t blame the platform. Blame yourself! There are no bad systems, only bad programmers (in this case). To answer my own question, I am tired of being in the minority. It’s laborious and tedious. I’m tired of complaining to other Elisp dev. For people that know me, you know I hate to say all this. It’s sad and hopeless. Why bother? You might have known why I put so much time into Emacs. I’m only filling the gap between Unix-like systems and Windows. And yes, all my packages work across all platforms.

Let’s define it first! The ELPA runs the fastest? No, that doesn’t make any sense. The ELPA serves you the fastest? Maybe. The definition for fastest ELPA in this article means it builds your packages the fastest! You might wonder why and how! Let me explain it to you! Normal ELPA, like MELPA, builds packages from the recipes directory, so it takes O(n) to do so. The more packages one ELPA holds, take longer the time to get packages to update to the server. The general solution is to use a more powerful PC to reduce the build time. Here comes JCS-ELPA, it uses the package github-elpa to host packages on the GitHub pages! But why is it the fastest LEPA? There are two factors: Microsoft owns GitHub so technically we serve our ELPA on Microsoft’s server We build packages using GitHub Actions with multiple jobs (if you are unfamiliar with GHA, think as multiple PCs helping you build your packages) JCS-ELPA builds your packages with multiple jobs simultaneously! The formula: New build time = Original Build time / jobs If jobs is equal to 1, then the new build time equals to original build time (no build time improvement). For example, if original build time is 10 minutes, and we start 3 jobs, the new build time will be 2 minutes. 2 min = 10 min / 5 jobs Of course, this is not going to happen in the real life. In reality, we will need to consume time on job scheduling, starting and closing time for the jobs, etc. But in theory, the more packages the ELPA holds, you will see the big differences between these two models.

As of right now, there are only 136 packages hosted on JCS-ELPA. I have split these recipes into smaller sections. Let’s say 50 per section! The formula will be: jobs = (total recipes / recipes per section) + 1 Hence: 3 = (136 / 50) + 1 Now you have 3 workers to help you build packages onto our server!

I attempted to use Google Domains since it’s the best choice from the video, but it came out it doesn’t support my country/region, Taiwan (WIP). So I go for the second best choice, which is Namecheap. 😅 Craylor Made explains very well! Big thanks to him! NOTE: It took them 5 days to complete transfer.

(NOTE: Cask and Eask are interchangeable in this section) Eask is the dependency management tool for Emacs Lisp. It’s like npm to Node.js; but it isn’t exactly the same since Eask has fewer tools than npm, plus their ecosystems are slightly different. Below is the link Why Cask? has a better explanation.

A simple comparison table below: Behind technology Cross-Platform Emacs Version Size Cask Bash, Batch, and Python (Windows) ❌ Good on Linux and macOS, but it’s particularly bad on Windows 24.5+ 3,000+ lines makem.sh Shellscript ❌ Doesn’t work on Windows by default 26.1+ 1 file, 1200+ lines Eldev Bash, Batch, and Powershel, etc ✔ Good, but qutie slow on Windows 24.4+ 4,000+ lines Eask Node or Native Executables ✔ Good, and it can be compiled to native executables 26.1+ 3,000+ lines (Table is copy and paste, please visit the site here) Eask’s advantages came from the behind technology choice; it uses Node.js and not Shellscript, Bash, Batch, etc. It would require us to use Node runtime, but we can use pkg (big thanks to vercel) for packaging into native executable to avoid such a hassle. I hope the needs to install Node.js and the extra step to call npm install are the only defect from Eask. So what are the GOODS stuff? Eask can be packaged into native executables; it should give you a better speed! It uses Cask’s DSL; it became very easy to adapt from Cask to Eask Eask-file is unlike Cask-file; it’s an Elisp file and functions similar to init.el (combined from Cask + Eldev) Use high-level programming language JavaScript; npm has a huge ecosystem. We can always fall back to the node layer if something doesn’t work inside Emacs (e.g. exec, init) Eask uses yargs as their CLI parsing library, which makes us only have to focus on the development Eask doesn’t require to call Emacs all the time; this is particularly good in Windows due to the fork operation is quite slow in the system (this is why I don’t recommend Eldev under Windows) Cross-platform and consistency; other alternatives don’t support Windows by default except for Eldev It’s easy to expand, and clearer project architecture; Cask, Eldev, and makem.sh have their files very huge, so it would be harder to maintain or add new features Global flag -g allows you to manage your Emacs configuration Eask sounds good, but it isn’t perfect. Here are the BADS: Harder to get into the development; you will need to know JavaScript and npm Eask project structure follows 1 command to 1 file; people hate having multiple files everywhere The project is much more complicated (same as no. 2) ","date":"2022-05-29","objectID":"/blog/emacs-eask/:0:2","tags":["Editor","Emacs"],"title":"Emacs Eask - Alternative to Emacs Cask","uri":"/blog/emacs-eask/"},{"categories":["Editor"],"content":"🧙‍♂️ Conclusion After seeing and comparing all the alternatives; I would eventually pick Eask as my major management tool. Eask has more potential if we compare it to the others; on the other hand, I think JavaScript and npm are very easy to learn. I have been using Emacs on Windows for 7 years; it’s quite painful. In general, many packages are either broken or doesn’t have a good user experience. I sometimes do have a good user experience but rarely. For example, magit, helm, is slow on Windows. Simple ping package eping doesn’t support Windows' ping.exe. Last time installing docker.el doesn’t work on Windows (1 week ago). I know the fact is Emacs is just too slow on Windows, but that doesn’t mean that we couldn’t do anything about it! The fact is user experience is still bad on Windows, though! 😅 Many people seem to use Cask, but the majority of them don’t require tests on Windows. It’s simply hard and inconvenient. You would have to install Python, and Python is particularly bad on Windows (UX wise). Here came the Eask to be the savior. It’s compatible with Cask’s DSL and ensures the workflow’s consistency (no Python). Hopefully, everyone can use Eask to develop their elisp packages. Maybe someday Emacs can live better under the Windows… What do you think? I’ve also learned Hugo; would love to share it one day!

Attention, learn design pattern is to learn how to build a better software architecture. Not to learn how to use a design pattern in your code! I have seen programmers use design pattern all the time and feel bad about it because they seem to be attempt to use design pattern instead of designing a software architecture. Once you have the skill and knowledge of design pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people build their tools on any open source platform.

In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying “Data Structure”, “Algorithms”, “Design Patterns”. What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc. On top of these concepts, this is the third framework I built. I could not remember what I built for the previous two framworks. I presume that I have some knowledge about building a framework, library, etc. At the beginning of the JCSUnity development process, I have had studied the basis of the game engine architecture but not quite fully understand the Unity Engine itself. For instance, Unity Engine’s Scripting API, and some controls specific for Unity Eninge. Because of this, you might realized some of the code or design are a bit fiddle and inconsistent. When I am writing this article, the framework itself has been developed to the state that is convoluted and hard to maintain. Within this framework, there are around 400 to 500 scripts, most of the scripts are self executed which mean a script is a component that could run by it own. By this idea, one Self-Runnable Script benefits the design and increase the variation possibility but it also brings the cost of unnecessary performance.

I am just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my Emacs and Vim repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs. Lead to the conclusion; I use Emacs more often than Vim. Before Vim users left the website, I would like to hold onto the basis, why I chose Emacs for my most frequently used text editor. First and foremost, I organized the editor users into two groups. Base on my own experiences, people who use Emacs are most likely work in the software development industry. On the other hand, the majority of Vim users works either in cybersecurity or a free hacker. The reasons are pretty much straightforward, as a software engineer, I would much appreciate Emacs' design. Emacs' architecture brings a lot more spaces and flexibilities to the software development workflow, and it maximizes the changing possibilities to the software engineer. Most of the software development is most likely to stay in a program that could likeliest achieve most of the tasks. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes, it is just another way of saying the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Of course, Vim could possibly do what Emacs does, extends to Vim’s original design, I found that conflict Vim is an editor design for fast editing file in terminal. Comparing the two editors, Emacs had been built the way what software developer wants; Vim would most likely lose in this battle on this aspect. Vice versa, Vim are very popular to those who do not need an IDE to do their job and often require to exit text editor to jump to other software, do not even argues that Vim is moving towards to Emacs' design. Well, this leads to a problem that I could not find a good reason for having the conflict between the original design fast editing file in terminal and having multiple plugins or configurations in Vim. Though, if Vim starts moving towards to Emacs’s design, does that mean Vim will lose the advantage on fast editing file in terminal? Many of Vim users complains Emacs was too big and cost so much of its' starting time, but now they want more plugins or configurations to their Vim settings? Emacs was designed between the lightweight text editor and heavyweight IDE, resulting Emacs could not going to be faster than Vim on the starting time, but it brings benefits to people who will like a ‘lightweight IDE’, it retains most functionalities from any IDE, or even better, program yourself one! If Emacs is that good why still not many people using it? The reason could be straightforward, I learned Emacs from scratch without any in-between supports like Spacemacs or Doom-emacs. I found that Emacs main website is not that friendly compared to other many sites. Plus, you could barely saw videos online that are about Emacs. Furthermore, compares to Vim’s shortcuts design, Emacs have less cognitive shortcuts consequent people having a hard time learning Emacs' shortcuts comparing learning Vim’s shortcuts. I would doubt anyone would likely to learn Emacs by having all these kind of challenges or difficulties in front of them. The learning curve is steep, and the cost of learning a new language for editing Emacs' configuration, which is EmacsLisp, could be an extra cost of time. If you notice programming language Lisp, then maybe this would be too obscure to you. In my case, I have no experience with programming language Lisp which leads me many hassles while learning EmacsLisp. I have been using Emacs for 4 years, and I still could not say that I am an expert to Emacs. I am not trying to, and I reckon developing routine is most likely imperative comparing to fixing the editor","date":"2017-12-10","objectID":"/blog/emacs-vs-vim/:0:0","tags":["Editor","Emacs","Vim"],"title":"Emacs vs Vim","uri":"/blog/emacs-vs-vim/"},{"categories":["Editor"],"content":"First the foremost, this article is all subjective opinions by me, and there are all kind of text editor for any kind of programmer. I think some programmer have some kind of religion, so I am not going to tell anyone to use any particular text editor. I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer make a software and get their job done. At my previous post ' Framework I have been working… (Part 2) ' I mentioned I watched a few episodes of ' Handmade Hero ’s series. Casey Muratori was using Emacs as a text editor coding C/C++(I think now he use 4coder instead of Emacs). I was surprised by how fast he can code in Emacs. So I made some research and discovered there is Vim which is another great text editor competing with Emacs. I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim. First, I would like to talk about why I chose Emacs over Vim. I think Emacs can do almost everything that Vim does. Vim stays cool he just wants to be a text editor and does not want to do something else. Emacs design the way that you could turn Emacs from text editor to something else. And of course, Emacs is not perfect. Emacs has few troubles doing something like you still need to use third-party software in order to run a package, and sometimes Emacs just froze when I am just trying to edit a text file. Emacs is just a right tool for me because I use to want a text editor that could edit any programming languages and do anything inside it. On the other hand, you might say that is gross to have a text editor do all kind of job for you. Why do not we just use another program instead of code in elisp and write your own functionality for Emacs? Is that even worth it? The answer is really depend on who is using it. For me, I program in different programming languages; I would somehow need to use other text editor or IDE when I change to code in another programming language. For example, I code Java and C++ I would have to change from ‘Eclipse’/‘Android Studio’ to ‘Visual Studio’/‘MonoDevelop’. And these IDEs has different key bindings, which I really hate because I would somehow make mistakes by pressing the wrong key binding from previous IDE to current IDE. In this case, Emacs/Vim become useful because I could finally code all programming languages with the same key bindings. On the other hand, if you are a front-end developer you would recommend people use Sublime Text instead of Emacs because it is wasting your time and is not worth it anymore.

I have seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure, so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly mean productivity in software development field? If you have seen my previous blog post ' Framework I have been working… (Part 1) ' and ' Framework I have been working… (Part 2) ‘, then you might already know what I am going to write about for the rest of this article. So what essentially methods that we could do to improve the productivity for ourselves as a software engineer? First of all, I would say build your tools. Anything that could speed up the development process will increase the productivity of the project. It sounds straightforward to make your tools or library, but when you start making it, it actually kind of hard to make. That I have heard of a lot of people asking me how to make a library for other people to use? Building a tool is hard and time-consuming. The first thing to make your tool is to have learned Design Pattern (I have already mentioned few books I recommend in my previous post - ' Framework I have been working… (Part 1) ‘). Attention, learn design pattern is to learn how to build a better software architecture. Not to learn how to use a design pattern in your code! I have seen programmers use design pattern all the time and feel bad about it because they seem to be attempt to use design pattern instead of designing a software architecture. Once you have the skill and knowledge of design pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people build their tools on any open source platform. As everyone knows GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, etc. Designing tools are thinking about how to make other programmers feel comfortable when using your tool. Think what kind of params have to pass into this function? Think is this feature that is needed to be here/design?

It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts work on the same project, and of course for game development students we decide to make a AR game. Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity. Because for whole semester I was so stressful, so I did not remember much what I did for the class in details. In fact, I did everything except the art for the project. It was fun and I did learn three things from this class. Never repeat yourself. (Duplicate code) Design Patterns. New technology is dangerous. Never repeat yourself, and the duplicate code is a significant part to be a good programmer Because duplicate code will cause copy and paste everywhere around the place. In architecture wise, copy and pasting the code everywhere is not a good structure and it could cause an issue if the program gets huge enough that you could not maintain the whole software. I am not saying I made the duplicate on this project, but what does annoying me is that I have nearly created everything the same over and over again in each project I have made from scratch. For instance, a scene manager could probably create for all kind of game because what kind of game does not need to switch a scene? Even a bad game will still need to switch scene from menu to gameplay. Design Patterns is the key for extreme programming and maintainability for software architecture. Prevent duplicate code is also the topic include from the design patterns. I would recommand people read ‘Head First Design Pattern’ that are written by Eric Freeman and Elisabth Robson. The example code was written in Java and as everyone knows that Java is a good programming language when people need to explain OOP concepts. Otherwise, there is another option book ‘Design Patterns’ written by a bunch of good C++ programmers, for people who feel more comfortable with using C++ than using Java. At this time, one of my instructor [Billy Garban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billylemonzest/) from Academy of Art University suggests me to watch [Handmade Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) series that host by [Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori) . I have watched a few episodes what make me impressive is how he can teach people in such a way that everyone could understand, including me. I like when he talks about what makes him special is his productivity to the company. (I will discuss a bit more 'productivity' in another post.) This changes me think differently instead of just thinking about algorithm and data structure. What makes you different than other programmers? Then I realize, being productive is important and advance as a programmer. Then I figure out that how to make myself productive as much as possible is to write your own tool. The reason is simple, the majority of people that are not programmer might think of the most time programmer did is to type the program itself, but I believe this is a huge mistake. In fact, the time spending on thinking is way more than time spent on actually typing. So writing your own tool is saving your time when you think. Here is a list of some frameworks or libraries that I have created for my own use during my college years. All of them have a different purpose, and some of them were written in various programming language. These are also the evidence that these tools did save me a lot of time when doing my school work.

Primarily I’m nobody, not phenomenal, and never been onto news or other media, not any of those. Is hard to think that who will spend their precious time reading this ‘About Me’ article. I would desire not to write a verbose introduction about myself. I’m currently 24; I wouldn’t say that I lived long, but long enough for me to review my past few years of living and consider what’s the future path I’m going to step in. The story always starts sad; it was entirely a disaster in my early life. I’m very pessimistic, give up things quickly, and not knowing how to be persistent. Wonder where are the differences between success and failure. Maybe I do have gifts for doing things right, but not for long. When I grew up a little, I’m already at the bottom of the class. I usually couldn’t be proud of myself especially when you have brothers and sisters that they often did things better than you. Util to the day first year of middle school, my life of concepts has a drastic change; my grade stays at the average rate, but instead of focusing on grades, my parent chose to have me entered the athletic class in tennis rather than the regular class. I felt motivated about sports comparing to coursework. During spartan training from our coaches, plus my innate health doesn’t take any advantages to make me successful in tennis. I finally got my first specialty by been through all the rigorous training. Form this experience; I learned the importance of being persistent, sometime you couldn’t care for all the possibilities, and confidence. Last year of the middle school years, I went back to the regular class. I decide to challenge something that I was always trying to avoid, studying. In the beginning, this wasn’t easy for me by doing something that isn’t that interesting. In a certain opportunity, I get to know some thoughts about life, which are “Life aren’t always happy.” and “In some aspect, no one like to study.”. I kept these thoughts in mind and started to do the hard work on studying. Surprisingly, my grades have some improvements. Although this could not be enough to be like the top 3 in our school, this makes me comprehend somethings that are way more important than the grade. “Exertion wouldn’t betray you.” and “Knowing the taste of success, would make you feel omnipotent.” There are a lot of things that happened in high school. The truths are that not everything goes perfectly throughout my life. During my high school life is my first time getting bullied at school, not physically but metaphysically. I reckon because I was too proud and aggressive at that time and I argued all the subtleties and most of the time I was right. Consequent that being always right does not mean success in real life. I was in despair about the reality and learned some significant lessons, not arguing so much and be humble. After the worst part of my life, I started to get in touch with people carefully. I attempted to learn how to talk to people and endeavored to be modest. I would like to search for my equanimity at any time and face things more mature. My life wasn’t going smooth all the time; I underwent both pleasing and hurtful part of my life. I’m not like Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla that smart. I learned lessons from every failure, and knowing from failure to success. Most of the time paying hard works wouldn’t get what you want, but you could change your life only if you tried.
