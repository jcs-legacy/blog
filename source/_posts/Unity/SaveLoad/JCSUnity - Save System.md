This is a introduction of how JCSUnity does for the game data save/load system.

There are main three ways that you could do `saving` and `loading` in Unity
Engine with C#.

* [JCS_BinGameData](https://jcs090218.github.io/JCSUnity/ScriptReference/index.html?page=SaveLoad_sl_JCS_BinGameData)
  - In binary format.
* [JCS_XMLGameData](https://jcs090218.github.io/JCSUnity/ScriptReference/index.html?page=SaveLoad_sl_JCS_XMLGameData)
  - In XML format.
* [JCS_JSONGameData](https://jcs090218.github.io/JCSUnity/ScriptReference/index.html?page=SaveLoad_sl_JCS_XMLGameData)
  - In JSON format.
