I have heard about people saying that writing a blog is a good idea. And 
here is it, I am going to write a development blog for myself. I have been 
coding for years and would like to share what I had been through and talk 
about more like what I think is significants to a programmer. What are the 
jobs and tasks to the programmer and what does programmer does?

這是我個人的部落格, 我聽說了很多人寫部落格有許多好處. 所以我決定開始
寫這個部落格. 這裡我打算分享我在開發時遇到的事情,以及我認為成程序員
應該要是怎麼樣子,它們的工作有哪些, 而他們實際上又在做什麼呢?
