**⚠️ The intention of this post is to remind myself why Emacs isn't worth my time anymore.**

I've been using Emacs since 2015. I have developed more than 150 elisp packages,
and maintained over 200 packages (including my packages). It's been a long
journey staying in the Emacs community, I think it's a good for me to slow
myself down and step back a little and think what I've accomplished through
out these years.

## 💫 How I got into Emacs?

Many people asked me this question, so I decided to reply it here.

I first saw Emacs is at 2015, seeing Casey Muratori's [Handmade Hero][] series.
I was blown away by how fast he can code in Emacs. How he can jump to other
window and never leave the keyboard are all new to me.

But if I look at his configuration now, it's actually not so great.
He doesn't use any third-party packages, so he has every defined in his own configuration
file (`~/.emacs` file). The configuration can still be great without using
those third-party packages, but it will only limit you and remake the wheel
that maybe others have already done for you.

Besides all of that, Casey is still a top-tier programmer I have known in my whole life. ❤️

## 💫 How much I've put my time to Emacs?

Like I've mentioned above, trust me. I put in a lot of time to accomplish what
I've done for the Emacs community. If you search all my packages, I hold the most
packages in [MELPA][]. The time I have put kinda proof how much I love Emacs, but
also how much I get disappointed with Emacs. 😥
