At the 'Framework I have been working... (Part 1)', I have talked about the
reasons why I started writing tools and libraries. At this time, one of my
instructor
[Billy Garban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billylemonzest/)
from Academy of Art University suggests me to watch
[Handmade Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive)
series that host by
[Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori)
. I have watched a few episodes what make me impressive is how he can teach
people in such a way that everyone could understand, including me. I like
when he talks about what makes him special is his productivity to the
company. (I will discuss a bit more 'productivity' in another post.) This
changes me think differently instead of just thinking about algorithm and
data structure. What makes you different than other programmers?

Then I realize, being productive is important and advance as a programmer.
Then I figure out that how to make myself productive as much as possible
is to write your own tool. The reason is simple, the majority of people
that are not programmer might think of the most time programmer did is
to type the program itself, but I believe this is a huge mistake. In fact,
the time spending on thinking is way more than time spent on actually typing.
So writing your own tool is saving your time when you think.

Here is a list of some frameworks or libraries that I have created for my
own use during my college years. All of them have a different purpose, and
some of them were written in various programming language. These are also
the evidence that these tools did save me a lot of time when doing my school
work. Think back in the past, when I start the project from scratch I nearly
will have to keep my eyes on the project all the time. But I after I have made
my framework 'JCSUnity' I hardly dot not have to do any school work anymore.
