While you are in the delima; we, human are totally normal to be afraid
of it. This may be a process; afraid make us strong, make us a much
experienced person. Human suppose to grow like that! So let it be!
Once you are afriad of something, don't give up on trying it; think
about the issue, think as hard as we can, and try to resolve it!
Even we couldn't resolve the issue, doesn't mean we are bad or the
issue can't be resolved in the later future.

We are often weak while we are facing the problam that are just too
tough for us human. We grow only when the delima are just right above
us. We can't simply leveling up by skipping it. Avoiding the issue/waekness
doesn't mean anything; I have been studying English more then 20 years,
but then I finally have the proof, I could got into a college that are
ranked in the first fifteenth. I have realized that avoiding the delima
doesn't affect you from any aspect, because I have came and eventually
resolved it!

Everyone has the time that they got beaten up. All we need to do is
stand up and move on to the next adventure. We all grow that way, so
you are simply not alone. You are, I am, all of us are. No one is
invincible, until they notice this.
