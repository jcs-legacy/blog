Acknowledge I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine.</description></item><item><title>Framework I have been working on</title><link>http://example.com/framework-i-have-been-working-on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Jen-Chieh Shen</author><guid>http://example.com/framework-i-have-been-working-on/</guid><description>The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts work on the same project, and of course for game development students we decide to make a AR game.
Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game industry.</description></item></channel></rss>
