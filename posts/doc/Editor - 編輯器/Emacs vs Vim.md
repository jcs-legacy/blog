# Emacs vs Vim

Precisely that I am neither an Emacs nor Vim expert. I am 
just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just 
amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my
[Emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs)
and
[Vim](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-vim)
repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold 
onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there 
are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid 
changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am 
not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge 
either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs.

實際上,我並不是個Emacs或Vim專家.我只是單純剛好在這兩個編輯器上面都有些了解. 
如果你查看我的兩個
[Emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs)
和
[Vim](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-vim)
的repo,那可能是最糟的經驗. 我秉持著一個想法, 那就是編輯器對我只是個工具. 
在我對於我的工具不滿意的時候我才會選擇去修改我的工具. 不是很必要的我就不會
特地去強求. 畢竟我不是要再造一個輪子,也沒打算讓Emacs或Vim分個高下.

Lead to the conclusion; I use Emacs more often than Vim. 
Before Vim users left the website, I would like to hold 
onto the basis, why I chose Emacs for my most frequently 
used text editor. First and foremost, I organized the editor 
users into two groups. Base on my own experiences, people 
who use Emacs are most likely work in the software development 
industry. On the other hand, the majority of Vim users works 
either in cybersecurity or a free hacker. The reasons are pretty 
much straightforward, as a software engineer, I would much 
appreciate Emacs' design. Emacs' architecture brings a lot more 
spaces and flexibilities to the software development workflow, 
and it maximizes the changing possibilities to the software 
engineer. Most of the software development is most likely to 
stay in a program that could likeliest achieve most of the 
tasks. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes, it is just another 
way of saying the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Of 
course, Vim could possibly do what Emacs does, extends to Vim's 
original design, I found that conflict Vim is an editor design 
for fast editing file in terminal. Comparing the two editors, 
Emacs had been built the way what software developer wants; Vim 
would most likely lose in this battle on this aspect. Vice versa, 
Vim are very popular to those who do not need an IDE to do their 
job and often require to exit text editor to jump to other 
software, do not even argues that Vim is moving towards to Emacs' 
design. Well, this leads to a problem that I could not find a 
good reason for having the conflict between the original design 
fast editing file in terminal and having multiple plugins or 
configurations in Vim. Though, if Vim starts moving towards to 
Emacs's design, does that mean Vim will lose the advantage on 
fast editing file in terminal? Many of Vim users complains Emacs 
was too big and cost so much of its' starting time, but now they 
want more plugins or configurations to their Vim settings? Emacs 
was designed between the lightweight text editor and heavyweight 
IDE, resulting Emacs could not going to be faster than Vim on the 
starting time, but it brings benefits to people who will like a 
'lightweight IDE', it retains most functionalities from any IDE, 
or even better, program yourself one!

先說結論,我是Emacs的使用者. 但為什麼我是Emacs使用者不是Vim使用者對我來講是
有一套根據的. 首先我對於開發者的理念以及角度做了一個簡單的對比. 依照我的個人
經驗以及橫跨世界的開發者角度來看,使用Emacs的通常都是開發軟體(Software 
Engineering)的較多. 則使用Vim的大多是駭客(Hacker)或者從事資訊安全(Cyber 
Security). 其實這個道理很簡單,相信可能已經很多人都發現了. 身為軟體工程的我
會更喜歡Emacs本身設計師的理念, 他讓了軟體設計師有了強大的韌性以及空間去做最
大幅度上的修改. 因為軟體工程師的工作大多都需要在一個軟體待得很久, 這樣聽起來
是不是對某個東西很熟悉呢? 沒錯, 那就是一個Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE). 當然一定會有人開始要爭論Vim也做得到, 但是那並不是Vim
本身的設計理念. Vim本身是為了快速地能夠在終端修改文本而產生的編輯器. 他是為了
快速而生的, 所以在建造這個Vim的時候並沒有在修改上有其專門性. 在這方面在Emacs
面前較會略為遜色, 相反的Vim在速度以及需要跨足到其他軟體的行業來講是非常受到
歡迎的,以及近年來改的版本也越來越傾向於Emacs那樣的設計了! 但同時也衍生了一
個問題,如果Vim是為了快速修改文本,再增加每一個插件的同時,也帶來了效能上的消耗. 
打開文本的速度會越來越慢. 這樣的衝突實在讓我百思不得其解... 至於Emacs本身設計
的同時就打算在這上面有所顧忌了,所以他一開始就沒打算跟Vim去比速度. 這也是為什麼
大多Vim使用者覺得Emacs太肥,因為Emacs本身的設計就不是為了速度. 他是選擇夾在類
Vim跟大多的IDE中間. 這剛好滿足了軟體工程師討厭的肥大的IDE,以及同時保留了IDE大
多數或者更棒的功能!

If Emacs is that good why still not many people using it? The 
reason could be straightforward, I learned Emacs from scratch 
without any in-between supports like Spacemacs or Doom-emacs. 
I found that Emacs main website is not that friendly compared 
to other many sites. Plus, you could barely saw videos online 
that are about Emacs. Furthermore, compares to Vim's shortcuts 
design, Emacs have less cognitive shortcuts consequent people 
having a hard time learning Emacs' shortcuts comparing learning 
Vim's shortcuts. I would doubt anyone would likely to learn Emacs 
by having all these kind of challenges or difficulties in front 
of them. The learning curve is steep, and the cost of learning a 
new language for editing Emacs' configuration, which is EmacsLisp, 
could be an extra cost of time. If you notice programming language 
Lisp, then maybe this would be too obscure to you. In my case, I 
have no experience with programming language Lisp which leads me 
many hassles while learning EmacsLisp. I have been using Emacs 
for 4 years, and I still could not say that I am an expert to 
Emacs. I am not trying to, and I reckon developing routine is 
most likely imperative comparing to fixing the editor's 
configuration.

但是這麼棒的東西為什麼還是這麼少人用? 原因很簡單, 我個人學Emacs的時候是學
Raw Emacs, 也就是什麼都沒有開始建起來. 我特別能夠感受到Emacs它的獨特性以
及它的不友善性... 它官方的文檔我覺得做的不算好,教學視頻也不是很多, 也沒有
Vim口令那樣的設計巧思. 根本就是一塊石頭. 在這樣的情況下,有誰會想用它? 在
學習曲線這麼陡的道路上,以及大多數的功能還要自己去寫,寫之前還得要去學Emacs
它們搭建的腳本層的語言/語法(Emacs Lisp),這些都是不少的工程以及時間上的花費. 
我學到現在第四年了,我依然還沒辦法很精通它. 也沒打算精通了,畢竟平時開發上我
認為比較重要.

Lastly, I would say these are just my personal experiences; 
this means all of these are just my subjective thoughts. Some 
could be right, and some could be wrong. Emacs have its' own 
benefits, which Vim also does. I often use Vim editing files 
while I connect to the remote server. Indeed, one more advantage 
to Vim is that Vim is pre-installed on the most system. This 
lead to the conclusion that there is no best editor, the only 
wise man knows how to use the right tool on the right circumstance.

最後我想補充一些想法, 這些都是我的個人經驗不代表我說的一定都是對的. Emacs有
Emacs的好處, Vim也有Vim的優點. 我也時常在服務端的時候使用Vim, 因為這是最
快的手段,而且還是大多系統built-in的. 所以我想結論是沒有最棒的編輯器,只有善加
利用工具的使用者!
